Advancements in technology and science have enhanced our ability to study and protect the natural environment. 
Satellite imagery and remote sensing offer unprecedented views of Earth's landscapes, enabling conservationists to 
monitor deforestation, wildlife migration, and the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, genetic research sheds light 
on the evolutionary connections between species, providing insights that can help guide conservation strategies and restore ecological balance.
